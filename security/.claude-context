Domain: Security
Purpose: URL validation and command injection prevention for MCP SSE servers

Key Concepts:
- validateSSEUrl(): HTTPS + trusted domain + metacharacter filtering
- buildSSECommand(): Safe command construction using array form
- Trusted Domain Allowlist: *.mcp.cloudflare.com, localhost only
- Command Injection Prevention: Shell metacharacter filtering

Important Files:
- validateSSEUrl(): Core security validation function
- buildSSECommand(): Safe command building with validation
- REQ-400 test suite: Comprehensive security validation tests

Common Tasks:
- "Add new URL validation": Update validateSSEUrl() and add tests
- "Review security changes": Check validation, array form, error messages
- "Security testing": Run REQ-400 suite with malicious payloads

Gotchas:
- Always validate URLs before shell execution
- Use array form for commands to prevent injection
- Domain allowlist must be restrictive
- Error messages should not expose internal paths
- Test with realistic attack vectors

Dependencies: bin/cli.js (security functions), cli-mcp.spec.js (validation tests)
