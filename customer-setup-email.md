# Claude Code Setup - Quick Start Guide

**Subject: Your Claude Code Setup Tool - Ready to Use**

Hi [Customer Name],

Here's your custom Claude Code setup tool as requested. This will get you up and running with Claude Code + VS Code in under 5 minutes.

## Quick Setup (One Command)

```bash
npx claude-code-quickstart
```

That's it! This will:
- Configure Claude Code MCP servers automatically
- Create your project files (CLAUDE.md coding standards, README template, etc.)
- Set up security-forward permissions

## Using It Successfully in Your Project

### 1. After Setup
- Your coding standards are in `CLAUDE.md` - customize these for your team
- Claude Code will now follow TDD (test-driven development) by default
- Security guardrails prevent accidental secret commits

### 2. Key Commands
```bash
# Set up new projects
npx claude-code-quickstart init

# Update templates when new versions come out
npx claude-code-quickstart update-templates

# Get help anytime
npx claude-code-quickstart --help
```

### 3. Best Practices
- **Ask Claude to plan before coding** - it will break down complex tasks
- **Expect test-first development** - Claude will write failing tests, then implement
- **Small, reviewable changes** - perfect for code review workflows
- **Security-first** - automatically denies access to secrets and credentials

### 4. Template Updates
When we release improved templates, run:
```bash
npx claude-code-quickstart update-templates
```
This safely updates your files with backups, so you never lose customizations.

## What's Different
This isn't just another AI coding setup - it's production-ready with:
- ✅ Security guardrails built-in
- ✅ TDD workflow by default  
- ✅ Team coding standards
- ✅ Safe template updates

Your team can use this immediately for real projects.

Let me know if you need any adjustments or have questions!

Best regards,
