# E2E Infrastructure Refactoring - Failing Tests Summary

## Overview

Following CLAUDE.md TDD methodology, comprehensive failing tests have been created for the E2E testing infrastructure refactoring. These tests validate the desired end state and will guide the implementation of fixes for all PE-Reviewer findings.

## Created Failing Test Files

### 1. `/test/e2e/infrastructure-refactoring.spec.ts`
**Purpose**: Comprehensive failing tests for all REQ-200 through REQ-205 requirements

**Key Test Areas**:
- REQ-200: TypeScript migration and type safety
- REQ-201: Architecture decomposition and module size limits  
- REQ-202: Real CLI execution (no simulation)
- REQ-203: Security hardening and input validation
- REQ-204: TDD compliance validation
- REQ-205: Resource management and error handling

**Current Status**: ❌ FAILING (Expected - modules don't exist yet)

### 2. `/test/utils/cli-executor.spec.ts`
**Purpose**: Focused tests for CLI execution module refactoring

**Key Test Areas**:
- REQ-201: Module focus and size limits (≤300 lines, ≤50 line functions, complexity ≤3)
- REQ-202: Real subprocess execution replacing simulation
- REQ-203: Command injection prevention and path validation
- REQ-205: Process timeout handling and cleanup

**Current Status**: ❌ FAILING (Expected - cli-executor.ts doesn't exist yet)

### 3. `/test/utils/security-validator.spec.ts`
**Purpose**: Comprehensive security testing for hardening requirements

**Key Test Areas**:
- REQ-203: Command injection detection and prevention
- REQ-203: Path traversal protection
- REQ-203: Environment variable sanitization  
- REQ-203: Buffer overflow and format string attack prevention
- REQ-201: Focused module architecture
- REQ-205: Error handling for malformed input

**Current Status**: ❌ FAILING (Expected - security-validator.ts doesn't exist yet)

### 4. `/test/utils/process-manager.spec.ts`
**Purpose**: Resource management and process lifecycle testing

**Key Test Areas**:
- REQ-205: Hanging process prevention
- REQ-205: Memory leak prevention
- REQ-205: Race condition prevention in concurrent operations
- REQ-205: Graceful error recovery
- REQ-201: Module architecture and focus

**Current Status**: ❌ FAILING (Expected - process-manager.ts doesn't exist yet)

## Requirements Coverage

### REQ-200: E2E Infrastructure Refactoring - TypeScript Migration
✅ **Tests Created**:
- TypeScript file conversion validation
- Type safety compilation checks
- Interface adherence validation
- Strict type checking enforcement

### REQ-201: E2E Architecture Decomposition  
✅ **Tests Created**:
- Module size limits (≤300 lines each)
- Function size limits (≤50 lines each)
- Cyclomatic complexity limits (≤3)
- Separation of concerns validation
- Focused responsibility verification

### REQ-202: Real CLI Process Execution
✅ **Tests Created**:
- Simulation removal validation
- Real subprocess execution verification
- Actual filesystem operation validation
- Real npm ecosystem integration testing
- Command failure handling (no simulation fallback)

### REQ-203: Security Hardening
✅ **Tests Created**:
- Command injection prevention (`;`, `&&`, backticks, `$()`)
- Path traversal protection (`../`, absolute paths, protocol injection)
- Environment variable sanitization (NODE_OPTIONS, PATH, LD_PRELOAD, etc.)
- Buffer overflow prevention (large inputs)
- Format string attack prevention (`%s%s%s`)
- Control character injection prevention

### REQ-204: TDD Compliance for E2E Fixes
✅ **Tests Created**:
- Function-to-test mapping validation
- REQ ID reference verification in test titles
- Coverage validation for PE-Reviewer findings
- Real vulnerability testing (not implementation details)

### REQ-205: Error Handling and Resource Management
✅ **Tests Created**:
- Process cleanup and hanging prevention
- File resource leak prevention  
- Race condition prevention in concurrent operations
- Error recovery for filesystem operations
- Memory usage monitoring
- System resource exhaustion handling

## Test Failure Confirmation

All created tests are currently **FAILING AS EXPECTED** because:

1. **Module imports fail**: Required TypeScript modules don't exist yet
   - `cli-executor.ts`
   - `test-environment.ts`  
   - `workflow-validator.ts`
   - `user-simulator.ts`
   - `security-validator.ts`
   - `process-manager.ts`
   - `e2e-types.ts`

2. **Implementation doesn't exist**: Functions and classes referenced in tests are not implemented

3. **Architecture hasn't changed**: Original 1037-line JavaScript file still exists

## Expected Module Structure (To Be Implemented)

```
test/utils/
├── e2e-types.ts              # TypeScript interfaces and types
├── cli-executor.ts           # Real CLI process execution (≤300 lines)
├── test-environment.ts       # Test setup/teardown (≤300 lines)
├── workflow-validator.ts     # Workflow validation logic (≤300 lines)
├── user-simulator.ts         # User interaction simulation (≤300 lines)
├── security-validator.ts     # Security validation (≤300 lines)
├── process-manager.ts        # Process lifecycle management (≤300 lines)
└── e2e-helpers.js           # TO BE REMOVED after migration
```

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. **Create TypeScript interfaces** in `e2e-types.ts`
2. **Implement cli-executor module** with real subprocess execution
3. **Implement security-validator module** with input sanitization
4. **Implement process-manager module** with proper cleanup
5. **Implement remaining modules** following architecture requirements
6. **Verify all tests pass** after implementation
7. **Remove original e2e-helpers.js** file

## Test Execution Commands

```bash
# Run all refactoring tests (currently failing)
npm test -- test/e2e/infrastructure-refactoring.spec.ts
npm test -- test/utils/cli-executor.spec.ts  
npm test -- test/utils/security-validator.spec.ts
npm test -- test/utils/process-manager.spec.ts

# Run existing E2E tests (baseline)
npm test -- test/e2e/end-to-end.spec.js
```

## Compliance with CLAUDE.md

✅ **TDD Methodology**: Failing tests created BEFORE implementation  
✅ **REQ ID References**: All tests reference specific requirement IDs in titles  
✅ **Real Defect Testing**: Tests validate actual vulnerabilities and requirements  
✅ **Independent Expectations**: Tests compare to external standards, not implementation  
✅ **Parameterized Inputs**: No hardcoded literals in test assertions  
✅ **Comprehensive Coverage**: All PE-Reviewer findings addressed with specific tests

The failing tests are now ready to drive the implementation phase of the E2E infrastructure refactoring.
