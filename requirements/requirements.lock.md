# Requirements Lock: P0/P1 Critical Fixes Implementation

**Snapshot Date**: 2025-09-16
**Total Estimated Effort**: 32 hours (4-5 days) - REQ-709 completed
**Target**: Production readiness with optimal user experience

## P0 Issues (Critical - Block Launch)

### REQ-710: Missing Test Infrastructure Functions (P0 - COMPLETED)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Core test infrastructure functions implemented and verified
- **Acceptance**: All test infrastructure functions implemented and tests passing
- **Details**: Core test utilities like createTestEnvironment() are now fully implemented
- **Impact**: Unblocks development workflow - test infrastructure working correctly
- **Implementation Summary**:
  - ‚úÖ Implemented createTestEnvironment() following TypeScript interfaces
  - ‚úÖ Added createFile(), createDirectory(), cleanup() functions to test-environment.js
  - ‚úÖ Created workflow-validator.js with security validation functionality
  - ‚úÖ All 14 test infrastructure tests now pass
  - ‚úÖ Cross-platform compatibility (macOS, Windows, Linux)
  - ‚úÖ Comprehensive security validation for workflow steps
- **Test Coverage**: 14/14 tests passing for REQ-710 core infrastructure

### REQ-711: UX Choice Overload Resolution (P0)
- **Acceptance**: Setup flow uses tiered onboarding with progressive disclosure
- **Details**: Replace 8+ simultaneous MCP server decisions with guided tiers
- **Impact**: Reduce 60-80% user abandonment during setup
- **Requirements**:
  - **Quick Start** (2 min): Context7, Tavily, GitHub - essential productivity tools
  - **Dev Tools** (5 min): Cloudflare, Supabase, n8n, PostgreSQL + Quick Start - full dev workflow
  - **Full Setup** (8 min): Brave Search + Dev Tools - comprehensive suite
  - Implement UI-only grouping with clear descriptions and time estimates
  - Add progressive disclosure: "Need more servers? [Show Dev Tools]"
  - Improve post-install messaging with next steps per server type
- **Estimated Time**: 6 hours
- **Dependencies**: None (UI-only changes, no MCP integration changes)

## P1 Issues (High - Fix Before Launch)

### REQ-712: Authentication Messaging Enhancement (P1)
- **Acceptance**: Clear upfront communication about authentication requirements per server
- **Details**: Replace authentication maze with clear guidance and post-install instructions
- **Impact**: Reduce cognitive chaos during server configuration
- **Requirements**:
  - **Better Server Descriptions**: Clear auth requirements per server
    - Simple servers: "üîë Needs: API Access Token (2 min setup)"
    - SSE servers: "üåê Needs: Browser authentication + Claude Code setup (3 min)"
    - Complex servers: "‚öôÔ∏è Needs: URL + credentials (5 min setup)"
  - **Enhanced Post-Install Guidance**:
    - "‚úÖ Supabase configured ‚Üí Ready to use immediately"
    - "‚úÖ Cloudflare installed ‚Üí NEXT: Run `/mcp cloudflare-bindings` in Claude Code"
  - **Real-time Format Validation**: Basic API key format checking
- **Estimated Time**: 2 hours
- **Dependencies**: None (UI copy and messaging improvements only)

### REQ-713: Function Complexity Reduction (P1)
- **Acceptance**: buildClaudeMcpCommand function split into single-responsibility functions
- **Details**: Reduce 15+ execution paths and high cyclomatic complexity
- **Impact**: Improve testability and maintainability
- **Requirements**:
  - Split into separate functions: buildSSECommand, buildNpmCommand, dispatcher
  - Create transport-specific command builders
  - Add comprehensive unit tests for each function
  - Refactor error handling to use typed errors
- **Estimated Time**: 6 hours
- **Dependencies**: Complete test coverage for existing functionality

### REQ-714: REQ-ID Test Coverage Implementation (P1)
- **Acceptance**: All requirements in requirements.lock.md have corresponding failing tests
- **Details**: Ensure TDD compliance - requirements without tests violate methodology
- **Impact**: Critical for maintaining TDD discipline and requirement traceability
- **Requirements**:
  - Create comprehensive failing tests for REQ-702, REQ-703, REQ-704
  - Implement property-based tests for validation functions
  - Add integration tests for authentication workflows
  - Verify all tests reference correct REQ-IDs in titles
- **Estimated Time**: 8 hours
- **Dependencies**: Requirements finalization

### REQ-715: File Locking for Concurrent Access (P1)
- **Acceptance**: Race conditions eliminated in global settings.json modifications
- **Details**: Implement concurrency control for shared configuration files
- **Impact**: Prevent configuration corruption during concurrent installations
- **Requirements**:
  - Implement file locking using proper-lockfile library
  - Add concurrent access safety to configuration updates
  - Create user session isolation mechanisms
  - Add integration tests for concurrent scenarios
- **Estimated Time**: 4 hours
- **Dependencies**: proper-lockfile dependency addition

## Legacy Requirements (Completed/Superseded)

### REQ-701: Critical execSync Array Bug Fix (P0 - COMPLETED)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Fixed in v1.1.1

### REQ-709: Undefined Variable Bug Fix (P0 - COMPLETED)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Fixed variable scoping issue by moving commandString declaration outside try-catch block
- **Impact**: CLI no longer crashes with ReferenceError when installing MCP servers in debug mode
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite validates fix with REQ-709 test scenarios

### REQ-702: Enhanced Error Reporting and Diagnostics (LEGACY - SUPERSEDED)
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è SUPERSEDED by REQ-712 (Authentication Messaging Enhancement)
