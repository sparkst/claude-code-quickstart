# REQ-715: File Locking for Concurrent Access - Implementation Report

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

### Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive file locking to prevent configuration corruption during concurrent installations of the Claude Code Quickstart CLI.

### Problem Solved
- **Race conditions** in global settings.json modifications during concurrent installations
- **Configuration corruption** when multiple users run setup simultaneously
- **No concurrency control** mechanisms for shared configuration files
- **Lack of user session isolation**

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Dependencies Added
```json
"dependencies": {
  "proper-lockfile": "^4.1.2"
}
```

#### 2. Core Infrastructure
- **`safeConfigUpdate()`** - Central file locking helper with retry logic
- **`safeFileWrite()`** - Atomic file write operations with directory creation
- **`safeFileRead()`** - Protected file read operations

#### 3. Lock Configuration
```javascript
const LOCK_CONFIG = {
  retries: {
    retries: 5,
    minTimeout: 100,
    maxTimeout: 2000,
    randomize: true,
  },
  stale: 30000, // 30 seconds
  realpath: false, // Avoid symlink resolution overhead
};
```

#### 4. User Experience Features
- **Progress feedback**: Shows "⏳ Waiting for file access" after 1 second
- **Lock timing**: Reports acquisition time for locks taking >1 second
- **Graceful errors**: Clear messaging when locks cannot be acquired
- **Timeout handling**: 30-second stale lock detection and cleanup

#### 5. Protected Operations
All configuration file operations now use file locking:
- `CLAUDE.md` creation and updates
- `README.md` scaffolding
- `.claude/settings.json` configuration
- `.claude/settings.local.json` local overrides
- Template file installations
- Agent file deployments
- `.gitignore` updates
- Backup file creation

#### 6. Atomic Operations
- **Temporary file writes**: All writes go to `.tmp.{timestamp}` files first
- **Atomic renames**: Only complete writes are moved to final location
- **Cleanup on failure**: Temporary files are removed if operations fail

### Testing Implementation

#### Unit Tests (`test/unit/file-locking.spec.ts`)
- ✅ Concurrent file write prevention
- ✅ Lock timeout handling
- ✅ User feedback during waits
- ✅ Stale lock cleanup
- ✅ Atomic operation validation
- ✅ Lock release failure handling

#### Integration Tests (`test/integration/concurrent-cli-operations.spec.ts`)
- ✅ Multiple concurrent CLI scaffold operations
- ✅ Concurrent template updates
- ✅ Lock cleanup after process termination
- ✅ Helpful error messages for lock conflicts

#### Performance Tests (`test/performance/file-locking-performance.spec.ts`)
- ✅ Minimal overhead for single operations (< 3x baseline)
- ✅ Fast lock acquisition without contention (< 100ms avg)
- ✅ Stable memory usage during repeated operations
- ✅ Efficient lock cleanup

### Validation Results

#### Concurrent Operations Test
```
🧪 Testing concurrent file writes with locking...
⏳ Waiting for file access: test-config.json
   (Another installation may be in progress...)
✅ File access acquired after 1s
✅ File access acquired after 3s
✅ File access acquired after 7s
✅ File access acquired after 15s

📊 Results:
  Operation 0 completed
  Operation 2 completed
  Operation 1 completed
  Operation 3 completed
  Operation 4 completed

✅ Final file contains valid JSON: operation 4
🎉 File locking prevented corruption!
```

### Security Considerations
- **Path validation**: All file paths are validated to prevent traversal attacks
- **Permission checks**: Lock files respect directory permissions
- **Stale lock handling**: Automatic cleanup prevents denial-of-service
- **Error isolation**: Lock failures don't expose system internals

### Performance Impact
- **Single operations**: < 3x baseline performance overhead
- **Lock acquisition**: < 100ms average without contention
- **Memory usage**: Stable across repeated operations
- **Cleanup efficiency**: No leaked lock files

### Backward Compatibility
- ✅ All existing CLI functionality preserved
- ✅ No breaking changes to command interface
- ✅ Graceful degradation if locking fails
- ✅ Maintains existing error handling patterns

### Future Considerations
- **Monitoring**: Lock wait times could be tracked for performance insights
- **Configuration**: Lock timeout could be made configurable
- **Scalability**: Current implementation handles typical concurrent scenarios

### Files Modified
- `bin/cli.js` - Core file locking implementation
- `package.json` - Added proper-lockfile dependency
- `test/unit/file-locking.spec.ts` - Unit tests
- `test/integration/concurrent-cli-operations.spec.ts` - Integration tests
- `test/performance/file-locking-performance.spec.ts` - Performance tests
- `requirements/current.md` - Updated requirement status

### Acceptance Criteria Met
- ✅ **File locking using proper-lockfile library** - Implemented with robust configuration
- ✅ **Concurrent access safety** - All configuration operations protected
- ✅ **User session isolation** - Lock-per-file prevents cross-session conflicts
- ✅ **Integration tests for concurrent scenarios** - Comprehensive test suite created
- ✅ **Graceful handling of lock conflicts** - Clear user feedback and retry logic
- ✅ **Backward compatibility** - No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Conclusion
REQ-715 has been successfully implemented with comprehensive file locking that prevents configuration corruption during concurrent installations while maintaining excellent performance and user experience.
